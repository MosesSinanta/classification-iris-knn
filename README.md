Iris Flower Species Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbours

## Overview
This study demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm to classify the Iris dataset into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor* and *Virginica*. The model's performance is evaluated by varying the *k* hyperparameter and measuring accuracy, along with other classification metrics. The goal is to provide a simple and interpretable example of how KNN can be applied to a small-scale dataset for classification tasks.

This study is for educational purposes, aimed at helping learners to understand the application of machine learning algorithms in classification problems.

## Dataset
The **Iris dataset** contains 150 samples form three species of Iris flowers. Each sample is characterized by four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The dataset is well-known in the machine learning community and often used for classification examples.
